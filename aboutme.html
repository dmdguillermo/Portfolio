			<h3>Interests:</h3>
				<li>Experimental Photography, both digital and analog</li> 
				<li>Music Visualization</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Inspirations:</h3>
				<li>Nature-There's a certain element about clouds and trees that captivates me.</li>

			<h3>Goals:</h3>
				<li>To expand my portfolio with unique visual content.</li>
				<li>To work with creative teams to finalize concepts for future music videos and/or short films.</li>
				<li>To maintain a personal artistic journal: a collective of sketches, thematic concepts, works and the process behind them, color palettes explorations, writing pieces, and inspirations.</li>
				<li>In addition to creating more digital works, I would also like to craft more hands on art: wheter it is drawing, painting, or sculpture.</li>
